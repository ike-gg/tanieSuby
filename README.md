# TanieSuby GitHub Pages Branch.

A website project that offered cheaper subs on twitch.
This project handles the website, payments, order management and discord & bot server.

Everything was written in:

- Frontend:
  - HTML,
  - CSS,
  - JS.
- Backend:
  - Node.js,
  - Express.

This is one of my first projects, publishing now because the service has been closed.
